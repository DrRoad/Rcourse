# t distribution

For 150 women the weight of their babies and if they smoke or not is collected. The results are presented in the next table.

| | smoker | nonsmoker |
| --- | --- | --- |
| mean | 6.78 | 7.18 |
| std. dev. | 1.43 | 1.60 |
| sample size | 50 | 100 |

Use the t distribution to see if smoking has an influence on the baby weight. 

```{r}
point_estimate <- 7.18 - 6.78
SE <- sqrt((1.60^2 / 100) + (1.43^2 / 50))
t <- point_estimate / SE
df <- min((50 - 1), (100 - 1))
p_value <- (1 - pt(t, df)) * 2
p_value < 0.05
```

# Confidence Interval

Calculate the 95% confidence interval for the point estimate of the previous exersice and validate of the conclusion is consistent.

```{r}
point_estimate - 1.96 * SE
point_estimate + 1.96 * SE
```
