# Rcourse

This repository contains the material to learn about the R programming language. The topics involve:

1. Exploring data
1. Presenting results using Rmarkdown
1. Version management with git
1. Using statistical models
1. Reading data from external sources
1. Analyzing the data using Spark
1. Presenting results using Shiny
1. Scraping information from the web using `rvest`

Every chapter has the following parts:

- An `{chapter_name}.md` file that contains the presentation used for the chapter
- An `*.R` or `*.Rmd` file that contains the exercises for the chapter

In the `answers` map all the answers for the exercises can be found. The `extra` folder contains examples that are not closely related to one of the chapters, or new chapters that are beeing made. Because I gave this course first in Colombia there is also a `presentaciones_en_espa√±ol` folder with the presentations in Spanish for most of the material. Finally there is a `references.md` file which contains all the sources I used for creating this material
