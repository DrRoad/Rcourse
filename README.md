# Rcourse

This repository contains the material to learn about the R programming language. The topics involve:

- Exploring data
- Using statistical models
- Presenting results
- Version management with git
- Reading data from external sources

Every chapter has the following parts:

- An `{chapter_name}.md` file that contains the presentation used for the chapter
- An `*.R` or `*.Rmd` file that contains the exercises for the chapter

In the `answer` map all the answers for the exercises can be found. The `extra` folder contains examples that are not closely related to one of the chapters, or new chapters that are beeing made. Because I gave this course first in Colombia there is also a `presentaciones_en_espa√±ol` folder with the presentations in Spanish for most of the material. Finally there is a `references.md` file which contains all the sources I used for creating this material
